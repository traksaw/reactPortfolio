        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>As the first-born son of Dominican immigrants, 
            I grew up understanding the transformative power of education. I earned a Bachelor of Education in Spanish and a minor in music from Kutztown University. 
            After teaching Spanish and music to youth in Philadelphia, I decided to transition to Apple as a Genius, which allowed me to merge my love for technology and liberal arts. Later, I taught myself coding, starting with Swift and mobile development and then transitioning to full-stack engineering. My mission is clear: I aim to deliver innovative solutions that empower others to pursue their dreams. If youâ€™re looking for a passionate, resilient, and results-driven software engineer ready to contribute to your organizations vision, lets connect and build something great together.</p>
